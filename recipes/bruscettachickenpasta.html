    <h4> If you like a good, rustic bruschetta...you're gonna love this pasta dish with pan-seared chicken. The freshness of the tomatoes, basil, and garlic will leave your family wanting more!</h4>
    <h1> Ingredients</h1>
   
    <h2> Chicken</h2>   
    <ul>
        <li> 3 boneless skinless chicken breasts, sliced in half horizontally </li>
        <li> 1 cup Italian salad dressing </li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon garlic powder </li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon salt </li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper </li>
    </ul>

    <h2> Bruschetta</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 8 Roma tomatoes, seeded and chopped</li>
        <li>6 basil leaves, chopped, or more to taste </li>
        <li> 1 head garlic - cloves separated, peeled, and chopped</li>
        <li> 1/3 cup olive oil</li>
        <li> 1/3 cup balsamic vinegar</li>
        <li> salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2> Pasta</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 1 pound angel hair pasta</li>
        <li> 1/3 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li> 1 yellow onion, chopped</li>
        <li> 2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2> Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place chicken, Italian dressing, garlic powder, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1 teaspoon black pepper in a resealable plastic bag; seal the bag and squeeze gently to coat chicken. Place chicken in the refrigerator to marinate for 15 minutes or up to 4 hours.</li>
        <li>Add Roma tomatoes, basil, garlic, olive oil, and balsamic vinegar to a large bowl and mix well. Season to taste with salt and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Remove chicken from marinade and add to the skillet. Cook until chicken is golden brown and juices run clear, 5 to 7 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer, inserted near the center, should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Discard marinade.</li>
        <li>Remove chicken from the skillet and set aside to cool slightly. Slice into bite-sized pieces.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook angel hair pasta in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove excess oil from the skillet. Add the 2 tablespoons olive oil to the skillet and cook and stir yellow onion until translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in bruschetta mixture and cook for 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Drain pasta and add to the skillet with the bruschetta mixture and chicken. Toss to combine.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and serve.</li>
    </ol>
